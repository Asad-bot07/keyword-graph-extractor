Description:
			An eight-year-old girl, who remained in four months of captivity and was found unconscious with her tongue chopped off in Sector 10 about two weeks ago, was raped too, a test has confirmed. 

The girl had earlier alleged Sudhanshu Shekhar, an auto-rickshaw driver of Salarpur, "abused" her and his second wife, Poonam, and first wife, Rita, had aided him in the act. Rita is staying in a house close to the victim's. 

On September 1, the girl had been admitted to the district hospital with "her body being burnt with cigarettes and private parts injured". She could tell her mother about the torture only a couple of days later. Now a report from the district hospital has confirmed rape.  

Sudhanshu had kidnapped the girl on April 30 and kept her in his house. She fled on September 1. Locals helped her and took her to the police. Sudhanshu reached the police station and identified himself as her uncle, but the girl refused to go with him. Later, the police realised the girl had been kidnapped.
