Street Harassment
Description:
			COIMBATORE: Desperate and irritated by the constant rebukes, two youth here in Sivanandapuram, attempted to force two college girls to watch a movie with them, by threatening them at knifepoint. As the frightened girls screamed, residents were alerted. They thrashed the duo, before handing them over to the police. 

All four of them were residents of the same locality. The police claimed that the accused were constantly following the girls and making unwarranted comments for a while now.
