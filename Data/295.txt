Noted human rights organization Borosa Foundation for Peace, Democracy and Human Rights have taken up the matter and have made a complaint to the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) about the matter. In a press release issued by the organization, they have stated that these incidents have exposed an ugly anti-people attitude of some rowdy and indiscipline Jawans involved in the crimes who are otherwise deployed to help in protecting lives and properties of the innocent people and maintain law and order in the trouble torn region. Condemning the incident, the organization stated that these are clear examples of Human Rights violation and because no appropriate actions was taken so far to punish the culprits involved in previous incidents, the  crimes have been repeated again and again in the district.
