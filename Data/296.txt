Description:
			A businessman of Lalita Nagar and his parents were convicted under Section 306 (abetment of suicide) and Section 498A (husband and relatives subjecting a woman to cruelty) after his wife committed suicide in less than six months after marriage. Judge of Mahila Court N. Raja Prasad Baba on Tuesday found Gudla Vasu Sai Reddy and his parents Parvathi and Sankara Narayana guilty and sentenced each of them to serve seven years in jail under Section 306 and pay a fine of Rs. 5,000 and one year jail term and pay a fine of Rs. 1,000 under Section 498A. According to public prosecutor Ramana Murthy, Vasu Sai Reddy (30) married Lalita (25) on August 28, 2005, and received a dowry of Rs. 5 lakh, gold ornaments weighing 50 tolas, a motorbike, and furniture. 

But he and his parents started harassing Lalita seeking more dowry. Unable to bear the harassment, Lalita committed suicide by hanging herself in her in-laws house on February 1, 2006. 

Vasu Sai Reddy shifted the body to a corporate hospital and informed Lalita's parents that she died after becoming sick. The IV Town Police registered a case and investigated.
