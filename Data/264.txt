Description:
			As the decision taken by the panchayat failed to act as deterrent for the errant boy, who belongs to the same village, the girl's family on Thursday lodged a formal police complaint. Ambala SP Shashank Anand has ordered the area DSP to probe the incident after registering a case against the accused. 

In their complaint, the parents of the aggrieved girl have stated that Pardeep, who studied in a college in Ambala, used to harass their daughter. "He would pass comments and purposely board the same bus our daughter used to travel in. After she told us about the harassment, we brought the matter to the notice of the village panchayat. Pardeep was summoned and he tendered an apology But after a few days he again started teasing our daughter and even forced her to exchange the telephone numbers threatening her with dire consequences,'' they said. 

"Initially she did not tell us and remained confined in her room. It was only after persuasion, she shared the problem with her mother," the father added. 

Meanwhile, DSP Kushal Pal Rana said the investigations had begun after a case of criminal intimidation and outraging the modesty of a woman was registered against Pardeep. "Our priority is to restore the girl's confidence so that she resumes her college routine. We will take action against Pardeep once the investigations are complete,'' the DSP said.
