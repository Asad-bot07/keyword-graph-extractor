Murder, Rape
Description:
			Yogesh Raut, the runaway prime accused in the Nayana Pujari rape and murder case, is giving the city police sleepless nights. Top police officials have expressed the fear that Raut may try to strike again if not arrested soon. 

Raut, who was arrested in connection with the rape and murder of software profession Nayana Pujari, was also arrested a year later for the gang rape and murder of a 22-year-old vegetable vendor, Vishala Mandal, in 2009.

Earlier, a woman living in Dighi had approached the Vishrantwadi police saying the trio arrested in the Pujari case had accosted her but she had somehow managed to escape.

Raut recently managed to escape from Sassoon General Hospital when he was taken there for a medical check-up. The officers who interrogated Raut told MiD DAY that Raut confessed to them that he used to get sadistic pleasure upon seeing a helpless woman and that is why he kept targeting women in isolated spots.
