Rape, Abuse
Description:
			The All India Christian Council has offered to work with the Uttar Pradesh government for advanced treatment of a dalit girl who sustained serious burns in an alleged rape and assault case.

The Council has also extended its offer to similar dalit victims who need advanced surgery and rehabilitation together with the pursuit of justice.

Although the state government is giving compensation to such victims, they need psychological post-trauma counselling, said social activist Madhu Chandra.

He said that burn victims also need corrective and cosmetic surgery on hands and faces as part of their physical and social rehabilitation.

A fact-finding team comprising National Integration Council Member John Dayal, former Lucknow University Vice chancellor Roop Rekha Verma, retired Inspector General of Policed S.R. Darapuri and social activist Madhu Chandra visited Juhari village in Sitapur district of the state for first hand information.

The team also had access to FIR, medical and forensic records of the girl.

The medical and forensic examination reports, however, have failed to either confirm or rule out the possibility of rape.

The police said that in the circumstances, they would continue with the investigations leading to a charge sheet covering rape and assault.

Mamta, a dalit teenaged girl, had sustained serious face and upper body burns when a group of five men allegedly raped her August 2 in Juhari village.
