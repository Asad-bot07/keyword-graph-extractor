Human Trafficking
Description:
			Nine minor girls allegedly trafficked from Assam have been rescued by the Crime Branch of Delhi Police with the arrest of a placement agency owner. 

A team under the supervision of Additional Deputy Commissioner of Police (Crime) P. S. Kushwah along with non-government organisation Shakti Vahini mounted a raid at the premises of Rajdhani Placement Agency in Rajouri Garden on July 13 and arrested its owner Munna Chaudhary (41). Nine girls were rescued. 

During interrogation Munna purportedly told the police that he brought the girls from Assam through his agents and supplied them as domestic helps in Delhi. His agents would contact people in rural areas in Assam and lured them with the promise of better future for their children and the prospects of earning money.
