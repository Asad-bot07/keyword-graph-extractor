Rape
Description:
			The Finnish woman, who was allegedly raped by a 25-year-old Mumbai resident in the early hours of Saturday, has a job in India and often travels to other cities. Menttanna belongs to Andaman and Nicobar Islands but has been staying on Yari Road at Versova in Mumbai with his parents. A case under sections 376 (rape) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of IPC has been registered against him. 

The woman told the cops that she had left her guesthouse in south Delhi with two friends, both expats. They had dinner at a Greater Kailash-I restaurant and then went to the discotheque. "She had drinks at the discotheque and was approached by Menttanna around 1.30 am. The accused - who works as a translator in a news agency - is a smooth talker and he soon struck a friendship with the woman, who even danced with him. When she was leaving for her guesthouse and was looking for a taxi, Menttanna offered to drop her home," the police officer said. 

Elvis allegedly took her to his guesthouse in Hauz Khas. When the woman told him he had reached the wrong place, he convinced her to stay back, claiming she could return home in the morning. The cops said she wasn't drugged, as had been alleged earlier, but she was raped by Menttanna. 

The officer alleged he threatened her with dire consequences if she reported the matter to the police. 

"He told her he would stab her to death if she reported the matter," the officer said. However, the victim gathered courage and called up the cops around 7.30 am in the morning following which she was taken to a hospital where a medical examination confirmed sexual assault.
