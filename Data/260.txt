Description:
			The Mahila police last night arrested a 24-year-old youth from Old Town for trying to outrage the modesty of a minor, while she was alone in her house.

The police said when the accused Rakesh Swain, who is a neighbour of the victim, saw the 16-year-old girl was alone last evening, he forcibly entered her house and attempted to rape her. When the girl shouted for help, he slapped her. Hearing the girl scream, people gathered at the spot, but by then the accused had fled.

Later, the girl's parents lodged a complaint with the Mahila police. The accused was then arrested from Old Town. The girl had sustained many injuries as the man had thrashed her as she was screaming for help. Her parents also rushed her to the hospital. The police said the accused was booked under Section 354 (assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty) of the Indian Penal Code. 

He was forwarded to court in the evening, said a police officer. 

Later, Swain was sent to Jharapada special jail after his bail plea was rejected by a local court here. 

Sources said the girl's family was from Bengal and had been staying in Old Town for several years. Her father was a businessman and the girl was a Class X student at a private school in the city.

Police said the 24-year-old Swain is an unemployed youth. He had no work and was seen roaming the area and stalking girls. It was when he saw that this girl was alone at home yesterday evening that he committed the crime, said a police officer.

The incident has once again brought to the fore the issue of safety of women and girls in the capital. In June, an 18-year-old girl was gang-raped in a moving vehicle by two persons who were known to her. They had taken her into the car on the pretext of giving her a lift. 

Both the accused are now lodged in Jharapada jail.
