Description:
			Bhanwari Devi, an auxiliary nurse and midwife from Jodhpur has been missing for 12 days. And her absence has begun to stir up a political whirlwind in Rajasthan. Bhanwari Devi's husband Amarchan has alleged that his wife may have been killed at the behest of a minister in the Gehlot government, Mahipal Maderna. Amarchand says Maderna called her regularly, and that his family is now facing a threat.

Bhanwari's husband Amarchand said, "Whether it's the Cabinet Minister Mahipal Maderna from Jodhpur or someone else, the government must give me a clarification on Bhanwari's disappearance. I want justice."

Supporting his allegations is the BJP, which wants a statement from the government on Amarchand's allegations and a CBI probe. The BJP has also spoken of reports that Bhanwari Devi was going to make a public a CD involving the minister.

BJP Legislator Om Birla said, "A cabinet Minister is responsible for Bhanwari's kidnapping and her killing. We demand a statement from the government. The government is under scanner now."

Another BJP Legislator Arjun Garg said, "Bhanwari Devi had told me she was hurt and wanted to switch to the BJP. She also asked me to arrange a meeting with Vasundhara Raje and claimed that she has got enough stuff to topple the Congress government."

Mahipal Maderna meanwhile has refused to respond to allegations.
