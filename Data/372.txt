Description:
			Two men have been arrested for raping a minor while she was returning home from tuition. The teenagerwas allegedly gang-raped inside an under-construction building by her neighbour and his three associates in a locality in west Delhi last month.

Police had earlier arrested one of the four accused, identified as Jasbeer. Two others, Rishi and Mandeep, were arrested on Thursday. The fourth accused, Jaiveer, is on the run.

"The accused have confessed to the crime during questioning,'' said additional CP (west) V Renganathan. Police said the matter was reported about five days after the rape. The victim, and her parents, lodged a complaint against the four accused after she fell ill.

The accused repeatedly threatened the girl with dire consquences if she told anybody about what had happened. On being questioned by her parents as to why she was keeping ill, she finally broke down and narrated the incident to them.

Police said a chargesheet in this matter will be filed on a priority basis in the next 45 days in keeping with line of zero tolerance towards people accused of committing gang rapes.
