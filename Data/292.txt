Crime, Rape
Description:
			The CID, Chhattisgarh, will soon take DNA samples of 25 policemen of Chando police station in Surguja, who were involved in an alleged encounter in July that led to the death of 16-year-old Meena Khalkho. 
While the police claim she was a Naxalite and habitual to sex, residents of her village Karcha have accused police of killing her after gangrape and then dubbing her a Naxalite. Following an uproar, the CID was asked to probe the matter. 

The decision to take the samples came following a forensic report confirming the presence of semen on her (Meena's) vaginal swabs and underwear. 

Dr R S Markam, who conducted the post mortem, has also contradicted the police version, saying the girl died around 3-4 am on the night of July 5-6, at least four hours before the cops say she died of wounds. The doctor addedOur observation suggested the presence of semen of many persons (on her underwear).

Investigative Officer B S Maravi (IG) told The Indian Express We could have taken the DNA samples but since judicial inquiry was recently ordered, investigations have been put on hold.We are taking the advice of legal experts.
