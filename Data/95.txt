Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			On April 19, 2011, a 14-year-old tribal girl was gang-raped by four alleged security force officers in Narayanpatna of Koraput district, where there is an ongoing conflict between the government and Naxalites over land and power. Additionally, Operation Green Hunt has increased hardship for the villagers following greater incidents of police violence. In November 2009 for instance, the state police and the Indo-Tibetan Border Force stationed in the district fired at villagers who had peacefully marched to the Narayanpatna Police Station, resulting in the death of two villagers.
