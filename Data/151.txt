Description:
			Peenya resident V. Srinivas has been arrested for allegedly chopping off his wife's hands in Ramanagaram Thursday night. 

Ramanagaram police said he barged into his in-laws house in Mayaganahalli village, chopped his wife Mamatha's hands with a sickle - right hand below the palm and left hand at her elbow. The ghastly act is said to be the fallout of a family dispute. 

Mamatha is being treated in a private hospital in Bangalore.
