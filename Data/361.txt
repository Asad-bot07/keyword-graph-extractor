Description:
			A woman allegedly killed her three minor daughters before committing suicide at Rasulpur in Bihar's Saran district, police said on Wednesday.

Mamata Devi (35) mixed poison in the food and forced her three daughters - Goldie (12), Rimjhim (8) and Jhahnvi (5) -- to eat last night before consuming it herself, deputy superintendent of police Ajay Kumar said.

All of them were found dead when the neighbours broke open their house this morning, he said. He added Devi might have taken the step due to prolonged family dispute.

The guardian of the family Nand Kumar worked in Mumbai, Kumar said.
