Molestation, Rape
Description:
			The 25-year-old victim had joined the police force on July 27, 2010, and Kamble was one of her trainers. She claimed that he called her to his home and raped her several times over a period of six months. The matter came to light when she got pregnant.

The Bombay high court on Wednesday granted bail to head constable Yuvraj Kamble, who was arrested by the Kolhapur police for allegedly raping a trainee woman constable at the Police Training Centre in April.

Justice RC Chavan observed: “Even if it is assumed that entire evidence is against the accused there is nothing remaining for the accused to remain behind bars as the investigation is complete and charge sheet filed.”

The court did not impose any restrictions on the police. “If you [the police] feel that he might tamper with the evidence then even on suspension you can transfer him to a different headquarters like Gadchiroli. Further, a senior police officer is probing the matter thus the chances of any tampering are ruled out.”

Kamble, in his bail plea, said he can be charged for molestation, but not rape, because there are contradictions in the complaint the victim made to the deputy inspector general of police (DIG) and the first information report.
