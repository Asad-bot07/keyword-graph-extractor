Foeticide/Infanticide
Description:
			Parli in Beed district came under the spotlight with the finding of some foetuses on the road in June. The police registered a case against Dr. Sudam Munde and his wife after these abandoned female foetuses were discovered. After a crackdown, 30 sonography machines were sealed in Beed district, which is emerging as a female foeticide capital of the state. The government has been conducting several sting operations to trap doctors who are revealing the sex of the unborn foetus.
