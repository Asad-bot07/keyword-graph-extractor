Rape, Abuse
Description:
			A minor Mizo girl who was sold twice, forcibly married and sexually abused after being trafficked to Haryana via Delhi three months ago allegedly by a Border Security Force personnel and his accomplices has been rescued from Rewari in Haryana. Five persons have been arrested. 

The 15-year-old girl, whose family is in the dairy business in the outskirts of Aizawl, was last seen on June 6. Police investigations revealed that she allegedly fell into the trap of a BSF jawan named Satyawan. The accused sent her to his village in Rajasthan and gave her Rs.3,000 for travel expenses. However, his brother Raju received her midway at the New Delhi railway station and in connivance with his accomplices, allegedly sold her for Rs.90,000. Satyawan, who proceeded on leave a few days later, was allegedly paid Rs.50,000 as his cut. 

When the traffickers learnt that the police had registered a case and launched a hunt for them, they panicked and allegedly planned to eliminate the victim. However, accused Dharamvir Yadav (30) chose not to kill her and instead sold her off to one Ram Yadav (60) and his son Dinesh (31) for Rs.50,000. It is alleged that the victim was forced to marry Dinesh and her name was changed to conceal her real identity.

A Mizoram Police team headed by a woman officer mounted surveillance on the suspects and zeroed in on Ram Yadav. In coordination with Delhi-based non-government organisation Shakti Vahini and Mizoram-based NGO Chan, they raided the house of the accused in Rewari and rescued the girl. Ram Yadav and his son Dinesh were arrested along with Dharamvir, Satyawan's relative Jile Singh (36) and Mahinder Singh (65), an ex-Serviceman. 

However, Satyawan's brother Raju managed to escape. Searches were conducted at Alwar in Rajasthan to arrest him and his accomplices. He is still at large, said an officer.
