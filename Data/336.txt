Rape
Description:
			The Central Bureau of Investigation on Thursday registered a case against BSP MLA Purushottam Dwivedi and four others in the alleged rape of a minor Dalit girl in Banda district of Uttar Pradesh in December last year. 

The Supreme Court had on September 12 directed the investigating agency to take over the probe into the case as allegations were levelled that Dwivedi being a ruling party MLA used his influence in the administration to dilute the probe. "On the directions of Supreme Court of India, the Central Bureau of Investigation has registered a case against a Uttar Pradesh MLA and four other private persons under various sections of IPC. The case was earlier registered by the local police and was later investigated by CB-CID of UP," CBI spokesperson Dharini Mishra said. 

The sections relate to rape, assault for outraging the modesty of a woman, voluntarily causing hurt, intentional insult and criminal intimidation. 

The 17-year-old Dalit girl was allegedly raped by Dwivedi in Banda on December 10 and 11 last year. The girl had escaped from his residence on December 12 when the MLA allegedly attempted to rape her again. The girl, however, was arrested after allegedly false charges of theft were levelled by the legislator's brother against her.
