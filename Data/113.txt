Description:
			A woman, who staged a dharna in front of the collectorate here on Wednesday, finally managed to make the authorities heed to her demands.

Thankamani, 42, from Neelamperoor, launched a dharna in the morning, alleging that the police had refused to act upon her complaint that was filed on July 4. 

The complaint was that a youngster in her neighbourhood had tried to molest her apart from threatening to kill her if she complained to anyone. Ms. Thankamani says the police refused to act when she approached them and on Wednesday, she submitted a memorandum to Additional District Magistrate K.P. Thampi, who is holding the charge of the District Collector.
