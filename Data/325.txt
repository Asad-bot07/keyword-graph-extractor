Dowry Harassment, Other
Description:
			The district, known for its unprecedented number of dowry deaths, has now become a place for brutal killing of children. However, the cause of the killings remains undetected till date.Five children were murdered between July 2010 and September 2011. T Aruna, secretary of Sthree Vimukhthi Sanghatana, a women's organisation, explains that it is the attitude of people that is questionable. "Political influence works well with police than any other factor. Police still do not have any clue of the case in which a girl was murdered in broad daylight by a masked man in Narasannapeta, she adds.But a senior police official denies allegations that the police were unable to trace the culprit. In retaliation, he says: "Teachers in the school have misled the police in the girl's killing case and provided wrong information about the culprit."While the district is turning into a childrenkilling zone, Uddanam region tops the list with many children being killed here. With these issues plaguing the district, parents now fear sending their kids alone to school, especially those parents engaged in farming and daily wage labour. Referring to the rampant killing of children, superintendent of police KVV Gopala Rao said all the five cases had their own motto and had no similarities. "Children are being victimised either for revenge or for money. We are trying our best to bring down such cases," says Prasanna Kumar, deputy superintendent of police PalasaKasibugga.
