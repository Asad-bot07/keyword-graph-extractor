Rape
Description:
			A local court here on Thursday sentenced a man to rigorous imprisonment for seven years and imposed a fine of Rs.30,000 on him in a rape case.

S. Jagadish, judge, Additional District (Special) Court, found Xavy Thomas, 50, of Kothanalloor guilty under sections 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 393 (attempt to robbery), 376 (rape), and 366 (abduction) of the Indian Penal Code.

The prosecution case was that Thomas attacked the victim and her husband while they were returning to their home at Kothanalloor on February 23, 2010. After injuring the husband, Thomas carried the victim off to a nearby rubber estate, where he sexually assaulted her. Thomas later fled with her ornaments.

Following a public uproar, the local police registered a case after initially refusing to do so. The Circle Inspector, the Sub-Inspector, and the Assistant Sub-Inspector of Kaduthuruthy were suspended for negligence during investigations. The case was later investigated by K.M. Anto, former Deputy Superintendent of Police of the Narcotics Cell.
