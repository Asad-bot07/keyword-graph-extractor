			Found guilty of culpable homicide not amounting to murder.

A wife-beater has been found guilty of culpable homicide not amounting to murder after he beat his wife up with a trishul, and sentenced to three years rigorous imprisonment with a fine of Rs.50,000, by a Rohini sessions court here. 

While awarding the sentence, additional sessions judge Kamini Lau said a message was required to be sent loud and clear that wife bashing has no place in a civilized society and violent husbands deserve no mercy. Wife beating is no longer inevitable and a private affair being legally outlawed in India and is unacceptable. There can be no justification for the same and wife bashers require to be socially exposed and publicly taken to task,she said. 

The convict, Ravinder (44), and his wife Sandhya would often quarrel and the latter would usually leave the house. 

One day when Sandhya came back to the house to collect her certificates, a quarrel ensued after which she was attacked with a trishul by her husband, his mother and his sister. 

She sustained injuries on her face and other body parts as a result of which she is permanently scarred.
