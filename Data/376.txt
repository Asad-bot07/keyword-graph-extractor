Rape
Description:
			A 25-year-old woman was allegedly raped by four men outside the Lonavla railway station on Friday late night when she stepped out of the station, looking for a restaurant.

Assistant inspector S R Gaud told TOI that the victim, who hails from Wai in Satara district, lived with her maternal uncle in Karjat. On Friday night, she was travelling to Pune by train to meet her relatives. She reached Lonavla station around 10.30 pm and had to wait for the train to Pune. As she was feeling hungry, she stepped out of the station looking for a restaurant.

Gaud said when she went to the autorickshaw stand near the Shivaji Maharaj statue, enquiring about a decent place where she could eat, one of the suspects, who was passing by, offered help. He told the victim that all the restaurants in the vicinity were shut for the day and he could take her to a better place some distance away.

The victim agreed to accompany the suspect. As they walked to the town, the suspect made a call and asked his friend to come in a motorcycle and join them.

"However, instead of taking the victim to the restaurant, the suspect took her to a secluded place. Soon, the three others joined him. They overpowered her and raped her," Gaud said. "They threatened to kill her if she revealed the incident to anyone."
