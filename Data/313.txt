Dowry Harassment, Rape
Description:
			A young NRI woman from Muscat was enticed over the internet by the owner of a professional studies college to come to India, given a job in the college, got married to him and was deserted after 20 days. Police have registered a criminal case against the man who along with his family is absconding. 

The family is untraceable although the father of the man claimed that his son is responsible for the crime. "But why have the parents deserted their home and are not accepting her as their daughter in law," the Station Officer (SO) Alka Agrawal told the IANS correspondent. Agarwal had asked the boy's parents the same question. 
The 22-year-old graduate from Muscat said, "I trusted his false statement that he can't afford to lose me." The man hid her in a hotel for 20 days after their formal and legal marriage that was solemnized on August 16 this year. 

When she insisted on visiting his house, the man - the son of a steel trader who runs a professional institute - told her to wait for 10 minutes at the hotel Krishna Sagar after checking out from their room on September 9. He told her to wait so that he could convince his parents to accept her as the bride, but he never returned, the woman told this IANS correspondent in the police station.
