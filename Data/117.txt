Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			A 13-year-old girl from Andhra Pradesh, who was allegedly gang-raped by four men in a house near Bannerghatta on the City's outskirts, has been rescued by the City police helpline for children, Makkala Sahaya Vani (MSV).

Two suspects have been arrested but the other two are at large. Shanthi (name changed) was allegedly sexually assaulted by four persons over several days in the house of one of them at Shanubhoganahalli. 

The matter came to light when the wife of one of the suspects got wind of it and raised an alarm on Friday. The news then spread to the entire locality and a neighbour informed the police. 

The victim was taken to Bannerghatta police station and later shifted to a local girls hostel where she stayed for a day. 

The police neither registered a complaint of sexual assault nor did they act against the suspects. Instead, they handed her over to MSV on Saturday.
