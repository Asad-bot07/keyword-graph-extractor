Dowry Harassment, Crime
Description:
			Angered by a deadlier combination of caste prejudice and greed for dowry that led her husband and in-laws to allegedly push her to what seemed certain death, a young wife swam 40 km throughout the dark night and lived to tell. Apart from Amrita Kumari's swimming skills, her love of life and for her husband and three-month-old son sustained her for 12 hours in the Gangas rushing waters.

When Amrita, daughter of an Aurangabad jeweller, fell in love with Adarsh Kumar Singh of Chapra and married him in December 2009 in Ludhiana, where Singh worked in a call centre, she didn't realise her in-laws' opposition to the inter-caste marriage and the absence of dowry would prove so dangerous.
She said she was thrown off Patnas Gandhi Setu by Singh and his uncle on Wednesday evening. Fishe-rmen at Rasalpur Ganga Ghat in Samastipur district, over 40 km away, saw her fl'oating senseless the next morning and rescued her. "My husband, his uncle, my mother-in-law and a family friend of theirs took me to the Ganga bridge in the evening in a car. My husband and his friend grabbed my hands while my husband's uncle and his friend grabbed my feet to throw me down into the Ganga to die, Kumari told a magistrate Saturday"

She said Singh's family was planning to get him remarried to a rich mans daughter with a dowry of 15 lakh.
