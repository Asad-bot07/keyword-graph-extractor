Description:
			Every second girl in the high prevalence child marriage districts of West Bengal were married off before they reach 18, the legal age for girls to get wedded, a UNICEF report said.

Murshidabad (61.04%), Birbhum (58.03%), Malda (56.07%) and Purulia (54.03%) are the districts having such dubious distinction, the report said quoting latest figures.

Though only these four districts have reported over 50 per cent child marriage cases, they are enough to pull the state figure of child marriage to a staggering 53.9 per cent.

Jalpaiguri (17.5%) is at the bottom of the 19-district list, with Kolkata (19.04%) preceding it, said the report which was released at an event on Friday.

A UNICEF spokesperson said girls should be enrolled in schools to push down the wedding age and there should be alternatives like vocational training for school drop-outs.

Lori Calvo, Chief of Field Office, UNICEF, West Bengal chapter, said, Evidence shows that educated girls grow into agents of change for their families, communities and societies as a whole.

We can have more of these change agents amid us if we can give quality education to girls which can be an effective tool to address poverty and fight diseases, she said.

The UNICEF report attributes the States situation to the patriarchal system where getting a daughter married early means one less mouth to feed, less dowry to pay and to the prevalent skewed gender values among the poorer section that for girls marriage is a must and education a waste.
