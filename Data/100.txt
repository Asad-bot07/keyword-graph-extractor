Description:
			A soldier was arrested by the police on Monday in Baramulla district after a teenage girl alleged that he tried to molest her while she was on her way to school. The area was shut down and stern action was demanded against the culprit. Residents told The Hindu that when she was passing an Army camp, a soldier caught her by the neck and tried to drag her to his post. She raised an alarm and some passers-by rescued her. This caused strong resentment in the area and people started protesting against the Army. They also blocked traffic on the Srinagar-Baramulla highway.
