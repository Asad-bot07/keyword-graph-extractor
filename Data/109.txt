Description:
			The Mahila Court here on Tuesday slapped 10 years rigorous imprisonment and imposed fine of Rs. 15,000 on a Chennai-based driver, Ramajayam (26), who, due to his suspicious nature, had disfigured the face of his estranged college-going girl-friend with acid at Kallukuzhi in Tiruchi last year. 

On April 27, 2010, Ramajayam had approached the girl's grandfather and coaxed him into believing that he was there to hand over photographs of him with the girl in his possession. Promising to give the photographs after a parting talk, Ramajayam took the girl to a nearby temple in the locality where he emptied on her face a bottle of acid concealed in his bag. The right portion of the girl's head, neck, hands and back got burnt, and she also lost her earlobe in the impact.
