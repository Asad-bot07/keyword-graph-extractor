Description:
			In a bizarre crime, a man has been arrested for allegedly drinking the blood of his wife after withdrawing it through a syringe, because she was unable to meet his dowry demand. The couple lived at Aanvri Barkheda village under Hindoria Police Station in Damoh district. The husband, 
Mahesh Ahirwar, has been arrested on Thursday, police said.
A case of dowry harassment under section 498 of IPC has been filed against Mahesh.

The woman married him three years ago, and her complaint states that he committed the horrific act nearly every day, because she did not bring money, and a vehicle.

Relevant charges would be pressed if the allegation of blood-drawing was established, said prosecution officer, Radhe Govind Arele.
