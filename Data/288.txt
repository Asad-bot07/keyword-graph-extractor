Dowry Harassment
Description:
			P. Anita, 29, of Akkayyapalem is a scientist in the Indian Council of Agriculture Research, New Delhi. Her parents performed her marriage with Sailesh of Vuyyuru in Krishna district in October last. Sailesh allegedly gave them wrong information claiming that he was a scientist. He was given Rs.10 lakh as dowry and an additional Rs.20 lakh in the form of gold and other valuables. Anita found out after the wedding that Sailesh had done his MBA and was employed in a private company as a trainee manager in Hyderabad. She initially pulled him up but later reconciled. Sailesh allegedly started harassing Anita for additional dowry soon after.
