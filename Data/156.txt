Description:
			Harassment has come to be associated with education. People are stupefied by the action of a college management. To strip search students on the campus for any reason is uncalled for. It is reprehensible and shameful especially if it involves young women. It calls for an examination of the reasonableness of the individual and the institution involved in this horrendous act of shame. 

People must have been shocked at a recent news report of a college near Chennai strip-searching a woman student to see if she possessed a cellphone! Cellphone may have been banned on that campus but is this the way to go about checking? Most educational institutions have banned the use of cellphones during class hours and it is absolutely banned inside examination halls. But the truth of the matter is that the cellphone has become a part and parcel of an individual and for an educational institution to strip-search or do any intrusive search in the name of discipline is not only galling but also sickening.
