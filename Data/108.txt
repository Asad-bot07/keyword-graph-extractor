Murder
Description:
			A double murder in a government flat at Pushp Vihar sent shockwaves through this south Delhi locality and stirred the police to launch a manhunt for a 40-year-old man, who turned up as a guest just hours before the killings. 

The prime suspect, Jagdish, had come down from the hills early on Monday with his wife and daughter. While Jagdish is missing, the blood-splattered bodies of his wife and son were found stashed in the flat's kitchen. Police suspect that Jagdish who hails from Uttarakhand had used the city as a transit point to snuff out his family. The murder motive is still unclear.
