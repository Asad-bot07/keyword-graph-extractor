Description:
			Eighteen-year-old Prathvi, a student of SMS Pre-University College, Brahmavar and promising national athlete hanged herself here on Tuesday September 27.  She was from Ampar in Kundapur taluk and was studying in II PUC commerce.

Prathvi was an emerging sportsperson, and had just returned to Brahmavar after winning a silver in javelin throw in the divisional-level Dasara sports meet held in Mandya from Thursday September 22.

Police on Wednesday September 28 arrested a youth in connection to the suicide case of emerging national-level athlete, Prathvi Ampar, at Brahmavar on Tuesday September 27. He is expected to be produced in court on Thursday.

The man had been taken into custody by police for questioning on Tuesday itself, based on a complaint made by Shankar Poojary, uncle of Prathvi. The police said that the youth confessed sending messages to Prathvi and called her over the mobile several times, and that he had been pestering her since some time, as he felt that she had not been in love with him of late, and ignoring him.
