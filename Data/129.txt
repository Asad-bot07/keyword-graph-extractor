Description:
			A man was arrested for allegedly killing his eight-year-old daughter after she resisted his attempt to rape her in the Palwal district, police said.

The victim, a student of class three, had gone missing since November 28 last year and a report had been filed with the police in the connection, they said.

The police on Wednesday recovered a decomposed body of a girl near a railway crossing here, which was later identified by the victim's mother.

The father of the girl first tried to rape her and later strangled the minor to death when she resisted him and then dumped her body near a tree, they said.

Victim's mother alleged that her daughter was last seen with her father near a railway track before she went missing. He had been sexually harassing the girl for a long time, she alleged.
