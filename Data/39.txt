Abduction, Human Trafficking
Description:
			Two women have been held for allegedly kidnapping a minor girl from Kapashera here and trying to sell her off for Rs.25,000 to a man for marriage. The groom has also been arrested.

The racket was smashed after the police received a complaint that a 16-year-old had gone missing from her house on Tuesday. The police zeroed in on Anu, 20, and Kavita, 28.

Acting on a tip-off, the police arrested them on Friday. During interrogation, the accused disclosed that they took the girl to Model Town on the pretext of seeing a relative admitted to a hospital. They then kept her in confinement.

The accused were striking a deal for her with a young man, when the victim overheard their conversation. Realising she was being sold, she requested the women to let her go. On Wednesday, Kavita allegedly took the victim to Dhaula Kuan where she was joined by Anu. 

They again had an argument with the prospective buyer named Sangeet, 24, over the amount, following which they returned to Model Town.
