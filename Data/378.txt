Fourteen people, including school students, have been arrested in connection with making an obscene MMS footage of a teenage girl in Hazaribagh in Jharkhand, police said on Sunday.

"All of them were arrested on Saturday. Some are high-school students," Officer-in-Charge of Hazaribagh Sadar police station Binod Kumar Singh told reporters.

The MMS was made allegedly at the residence of Vikas Kumar Singh and his friend Ajit Singh a few days ago with the latter's 17-year-old girl friend.

The room was fitted with six cameras and a pornographic film was prepared with the help of the employee of a cyber cafe and was circulated through MMS, Singh said.
