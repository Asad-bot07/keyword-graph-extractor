Sexual Harassment at Work
Description:
			Three months after a crime branch lady constable alleged sexual harassment at workplace by a senior police officer, she was relieved on Monday from her present place of posting.

Police chief Aditya Arya has failed to take any action against the accused police officer who has till date not appeared before the Goa police's sexual harassment at workplace committee.

This, despite the committee sending a notice on August 9 to the accused officer to appear before it. The woman constable was relieved from the crime branch on Tuesday, despite a file noting by the inspector general of police (IGP) stating, "the LPC (lady police constable) be asked to continue working in the crime branch itself". This was done after SP (crime) submitted a report to the IGP informing that on July 5, a lady constable who is working in the crime branch since August 2010, has alleged sexual harassment by DySP Shambha Sawant. After a preliminary inquiry, crime branch handed the matter to the police's sexual harassment at workplace committee. The relieving order was issued on September 14 to the victim with instructions to report to police headquarters. But, as the victim was part of the crime branch team investigating sensitive cases, DySP (crime) Chandrakant Salgaonkar did not relieve her.
