Abuse
Description:
			The Madras High Court on Monday directed the authorities, including the Director-General of Police, to immediately arrest all the accused involved in the barbaric acts of sexually abusing a four-year-old school girl at Kallakurichi in Villupuram district.

It also directed the Superintendent of Police, Villupuram district, and the Inspector, Kallakurichi police station, to appear in person before the court on Tuesday.

Pulling up the police, the First Bench comprising Chief Justice M.Y. Eqbal and Justice T.S. Sivagnanam observed It is a matter of great concern and even astonishing to note that even the police department of the State is not in a position to arrest the named persons, who have committed such a heinous crime on a girl child, aged four years.

The Inspector of Police concerned has not even disclosed the name of the person who has been arrested after investigation. The Bench passed the interim order on a writ petition, filed by A. Ramalingam of Soundaravallipalayam and a member of the Human Rights Protection Centre, Villupuram, alleging that an LKG class teacher and the principal of the school sexually harassed the child, studying in UKG.

A complaint had been preferred by the child's mother on August 3 this year.
