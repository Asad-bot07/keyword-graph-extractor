Description:
			A Sub Registrar, a DRDA official, and a private employee were arrested on Thursday on the charge of sending malicious mails to a woman official.

The main accused Satyanarayana (Sub Registrar), allegedly in collusion with the DRDA official L. Bhaskar Rao and a private employee Ramachandra Rao, created a fake email ID and sent the malicious mails to the DIG of Stamps and Registration Department Saroja accusing her of indulging in corruption apart from casting aspersions on her character. 

They also allegedly sent malicious emails to other Sub Registrars in the State, the Joint Collector, and the Collector. 

Satyanarayana allegedly nursed a grouse against the DIG as she had transferred him against his will in the past and had issued memos to him for his corrupt practices. The DIG lodged a complaint with the Three Town police on August 1 and the case was transferred to the Cyber Crime Cell.

The accused were arrested by the Cyber Crime Inspector Penta Rao. Investigation is on.
