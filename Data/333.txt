Foeticide/Infanticide, Crime
Description:
			Unhappy over the indifferent attitude of the district administration in investigating cases of female infanticide reported from Jaisalmer in Rajasthan last month, the National Commission on Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) has ordered re-investigation.

A team of the NCPCR that recently visited Jaisalmer to look into the complaints of female infanticide, has directed the district administration to reinvestigate the circumstances leading to the death of three baby girls believed to have been killed by their families soon after leaving the health facilities last month. They have been asked to submit a report to the Commission within the next 10 days.
