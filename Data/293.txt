Crime, Dowry Harassment
Description:
			In a gruesome incident, a man slit the throat of his wife at Malkapuram police station on Sunday evening when she went there to file a dowry harassment case.

She was admitted to a private hospital in Gajuwaka, where she is undergoing treatment. According to the police, the accused, A. Robin Moses, who was arrested immediately after the incident, entered into wedlock with Sabitarani Patnaik two years ago after deserting his first wife. Sabita, daughter of an employee of Hindustan Shipyard Ltd, had first complained to the police against Moses, a private employee, last year that he was torturing her for dowry. The police sent them home after some counselling. As there was no change in his behaviour, she approached the police again with a complaint on Sunday.

Sabita gave birth to a baby boy at her parents' house three months ago. After Sabita returned a few days ago, Moses allegedly harassed her for dowry and also threatened her parents.

At around 7.30 p.m., Sabita went to the Malkapuram police station to lodge a complaint. The police also called Moses. While Sabita was filing the complaint, Moses allegedly slit her throat with a knife.
