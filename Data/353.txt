Rape, Crime
Description:
			More than a year after the body of a 19-year-old girl was found dead in a garment unit at Dadar, a forensic report shows that the accused may have attempted to rape her before killing her. The Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL) at Kalina has sent the report to the Dadar police, which shows that the skin tissues found under the victim's nails match the DNA of the accused, Nagendra Paswan, 25. 

The report also states that semen samples found in the victim's private parts matched Paswan's DNA.

Inspector Jayant Pardesi, investigating officer of the case said, If the tests do prove that Paswan had attempted to rape the victim, the necessary charges will be filed against the accused, he added. 

Paswan told the police that on July 18, he called the girl to his room, on the ground floor of the garment unit office, claiming that he had something important to discuss. The victim went to the unit and they reportedly had an argument, after which he allegedly strangled her and fled.
