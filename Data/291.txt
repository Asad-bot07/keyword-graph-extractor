Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			Two Special Police Officers (SPO) of the Chhattisgarh police have been arrested for allegedly raping a minor girl in Chindgarh, Dantewada.

The incident occurred at about 4 o clock on Wednesday. The victim was in her family's field, about three km from Chindgarh when the two SPOs caught her and raped her, said G.R. Negi, a resident of Chindargh and office bearer of the Communist Party of India. The two men, identified as Sunnam Arjun and Karam Manga, were arrested today.

Chhattisgarh's police force has been repeatedly accused of sexually assaulting young women in districts affected by the Maoist insurgency. Last month, the State government ordered a probe into allegations that policemen in Surguja district raped and killed another young girl called Meena Khalko during a counterinsurgency operation in July. The police later claimed that Ms. Khalko was a member of the guerilla army of the banned Communist Party of India (Maoist). In March, villagers from Tarmetla and Morpalli villages in Dantewada also accused security forces of sexually assaulting three women during an anti-Maoist operation spanning many days.

Chhattisgarh's SPOs primarily consist of young tribal men hired by the police on a temporary basis, and were initially armed used at the frontlines of anti-Maoist operations. On July 5 this year, the Supreme Court of India held that the SPOs were barely educated, poorly trained youth and ordered the police to desist from using them in such missions. The State government subsequently issued an ordinance that seeks to absorb the SPOs into a regular force called the Chhattisgarh Armed Auxiliary Force.
