Crime, Rape
Description:
			A 32-year-old engineer from Hyderabad was arrested for allegedly raping a Delhi woman and cheating her of Rs.2.5 lakh on the pretext of marrying her, police said Wednesday.

Mohammad Sirajuddin Ahmed was arrested from his house in Hyderabad Tuesday after a long chase, Delhi Deputy Commissioner of Police Chhaya Sharma said. 

Police said Ahmed came in touch with the victim in January through a marriage website.

The victim, a resident of Mehrauli in south Delhi, filed a complaint Aug 18 and made the allegations against Ahmed, a director of Prince Educational Society in Hyderabad, Sharma said. 

Police found that the victim only knew the name of the accused. She neither had his photograph nor his address. 

A police team was sent to Hyderabad to nab him but without success. "Even the address given to open a bank account was false," Sharma said.

But later they found an advertisement of Gold Cup T-20 Cricket matches to be held in six cities in south India to be organised by the All India Charminar Sports Academy (AICSA) from Sep 22 and the telephone number given there was found to be that of Ahmed.

"He was arrested and brought to Delhi," Sharma said. 

Ahmed, a son of a retired inspector in Maharashtra Police, told police that he had physical relations with the victim - in Bhopal and Delhi - on the pretext of getting married and then dumped her. 

He also said that he withdrew Rs.2.5 lakh from her account, said Sharma.
